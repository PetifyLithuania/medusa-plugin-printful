# Medusa Printful Plugin

This plugin integrates Medusa with Printful. It allows you to sync your products from Printful and create orders in
Printful from Medusa. It is listening to events on both sides and will keep the two systems in sync.

## Plugin configuration

The plugin requires a few configuration options to be set in order to work. These can be set in `medusa-config.js` in
your server root directory.
